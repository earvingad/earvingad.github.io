[{"categories":null,"content":" First things first   This place is going to be my personal blog. I am going to write about nerd things I don't generally speak with people. Such things include: Emacs, linux, vim, encryption and a e s t h e t i c s.  This blog is hosted in github, written in Emacs with org-mode and posted with Hugo (This is one of the topics I'll be posting later: How to blog with github and Hugo).  Recently, I started using emacs at work due to org-mode. I have used emacs in linux for a few months after loving LaTex previews (I am going to post about this later as well). However, at work I have to use windows under heavily firewalls and that complicate the Emacs installation.  I have always though that Emacs is neat. Just reading the name in a monospaced font makes me think that Emacs is elegant. I love Emacs and I used the vanilla key-bindings when I started using it, but never liked them. When I decided to used Emacs, I remember reading the documentation for minimal use and it went something like:   So you just have to press C-u C-x C-c … wait what??   I was very used to vim key-bindings, so the Emacs learning curve was very long. After some months, I was able to use Emacs comfortably for taking quick notes at work meetings and organizing my pending tasks (Yes, TODO's), but the key-bindings were tedious.  Luckily, there are frameworks that allows you to emulate vim key-bindings in Emacs. Some of these frameworks are: Spacemacs, Centaur Emacs and Doom-emacs. The latest, is the one I use now and installing in windows was and Odyssey but worth it!  The next posts are going to be about:    How to install Doom-emacs in windows    Org-mode \u0026 org-roam    … and we'll see.
