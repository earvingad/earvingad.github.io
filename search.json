[{"categories":null,"content":"  Doom-emacs. It's a configuration framework for Emacs. Basically, it overrides the Emacs keybindings with most of vim's.  As I mentioned in the last post. I started using Emacs at work due to org-mode… and work PC's use windows behind a Firewall, so using git, pip, melpa and some more are useless in my work desktop (In the Laptop all of them work if I connect to another network, which was what I did).  As you can imagine, Doom is for a GNU program so Windows support is limited (because, who cares?). The guide is poor, it describes how to install it with scoop/chocolatey (that don't work with a firewall). However, you can use the git-bash to install Doom without scoop/chocolatey. Here is how you do it: What you need   If you have limited permissions in Windows PC (e.g. admin privileges), you might not be able to use Chocolatey/Scoop. However, you can still use git-bash.exe portable version!    Download git.    Download Ripgrep and fd. Make sure you download the windows-gnu version.    Of course, download emacs.    Extract the binaries1 from Ripgrep and fd to their respective folders and place them where you want.    You should have one folder for Ripgrep and another for fd.    Extract emacs and place it where you want. It does not matter where they are, we will add them to the Path later (but keep them safe and where you can remember). Instructions  Edit system environment variables     Go to Control panel -\u003e User Accounts -\u003e Change my environment variables.    New, type HOME and set your C:\\Users\\USERNAME and OK.    Select Path, edit and add your C:\\path\\to\\the\\emacs\\bin folder and OK.    Select Path, edit and add your C:\\path\\to\\the\\ripgrep folder and OK.    Select Path, edit and add your C:\\path\\to\\the\\fd folder and OK.    Click Ok.      We still need to add C:\\Users\\USERNAME\\.emacs.d\\bin; but first download Doom files.   Install Doom     Open git-bash.exe    Type cd ~    Run: git clone https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs ~/.emacs.d    After the download is completed, type cd =/.emacs.d/bin and run: ./doom install    If everything is fine, Doom is now installed.    Just in case run ./doom sync    Go to Control panel -\u003e User Accounts -\u003e Change my environment variables.    Select Path, edit and add C:\\Users\\USERNAME\\.emacs.d\\bin, click OK -\u003e OK.      Now you can start emacs and will see the Doom dashboard!   All the icons   By default all-the-icons will not be enabled in Windows.    If all-the-icons is not installed. Open emacs and M-x package-install RET all-the-icons RET.    M-x all-the-icons-install-fonts select where to download the fonts and install them (double click -\u003e install).    Restart emacs and there you go.   From one PC to another   If one of your PCs does not have internet connection or is under a firewall, you can:    Copy your ~/.doom.d ~/.emacs.d ripgrep fd emacs folders directly to the other PC (~/.domm.d ~/.emacs.d go in C:\\Users\\USERNAME)    Edit the system environment variables accordingly.    Copy and install the fonts you downloaded with all-the-icons    Open git-bash.exe, cd ~/.emacs.d/bin and run: ./doom sync    et voilà!.   Emacs server   If you use emacs server, Doom will place the server file in C:\\Users\\USERNAME\\.emacs.d\\.local\\cache\\server folder.    Go to Control panel -\u003e User Accounts -\u003e Change my environment variables.    New type EMACS_SERVER_FILE and set the file path C:\\Users\\USERNAME\\.emacs.d\\.local\\cache\\server\\server.    Create a emacsclientw.exe shortcut with emacsclientw.exe -nc in target, run emacs server and emacsclientw will work.      Now, rejoice!

I am going to write about nerd things I don't generally speak with people. Such things include: Emacs, linux, vim, encryption and a e s t h e t i c s.  This blog is hosted in github, written in Emacs with org-mode and posted with Hugo (This is one of the topics I'll be posting later: How to blog with github and Hugo).  Recently, I started using emacs at work due to org-mode. I have used emacs in linux for a few months after loving LaTex previews (I am going to post about this later as well). However, at work I have to use windows under heavily firewalls and that complicate the Emacs installation.  I have always though that Emacs is neat. Just reading the name in a monospaced font makes me think that Emacs is elegant. I love Emacs and I used the vanilla key-bindings when I started using it, but never liked them. When I decided to used Emacs, I remember reading the documentation for minimal use and it went something like:   So you just have to press C-u C-x C-c … wait what??   I was very used to vim key-bindings, so the Emacs learning curve was very long. After some months, I was able to use Emacs comfortably for taking quick notes at work meetings and organizing my pending tasks (Yes, TODO's), but the key-bindings were tedious.  Luckily, there are frameworks that allows you to emulate vim key-bindings in Emacs. Some of these frameworks are: Spacemacs, Centaur Emacs and Doom-emacs. The latest, is the one I use now and installing in windows was and Odyssey but worth it!  The next posts are going to be about:    How to install Doom-emacs in windows    Org-mode \u0026 org-roam    … and we'll see.
