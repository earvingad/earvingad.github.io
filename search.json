[{"categories":["orgmode","roam","windows"],"content":" Org-roam   Org-roam is a note-taking tool for Emacs using Org-mode. It is a replica of RoamResearch: \"A note-taking tool for networked thought\". Both are based in the Zettelkasten method, which is described as:   Using a Zettelkasten is about optimizing a workflow of learning and producing knowledge.   The method was developed by Niklas Luhmann and the literal translation is:  Zettelkasten = Box of notes.   In simple words: Org-roam allows you to make connections between your notes, in order to make a more efficient creative/learning process.  You can read a more detailed introduction to Zettelkasten in here and here. Further reading in the official site and some help for workflow.  \"Your mind is for having ideas, not holding them.\" –David Allen  Installing Org-roam   This post assumes you have already installed DoomEmacs in Windows (Doom, Emacs \u0026 Windows). Most of the instructions were taken from Org-roam official site    Download the Official binary of sqlite3 (the one that includes the command-line shell program aka the .exe)    Extract it and add it to your path.    You can check Doom, Emacs \u0026 Windows to see how to add it to your path.      In Emacs, install the emacsql-sqlite3 package    Using DoomEmacs, just add (package! emacsql-sqlite3) in your packages.el (located in C:\\Users\\yourusername\\.doom.d\\1 or ~/.doom.d)    and run ~/.emacs.d/bin/doom sync in the git-bash.      Using a text editor (e.g. notepad) modify org-roam-db.el (located in ~/.emacs.d/.local/straight/repos/emacsql-sqlite3/):    Replace (require 'emacsql-sqlite) with (require 'emacsql-sqlite3)    Comment/deactivate or delete the complete function (defconst org-roam-db--sqlite-available-p ... )      In the function (defun org-roam-db ..., replace emacsql-sqlite with emacsql-sqlite3    If you compile .el files, ensure to replace org-roam-db.elc with the new source you modified.    In other words: delete the ~/.emacs.d/.local/straight/build/org-roam-db.elc    And run ~/.emacs.d/bin/doom sync once more.      Back in Emacs, install and configure org-roam    Open ~/.doom.d/init.el and replace org, in :lang section, with (org +roam)    Define your org-roam-directory in your config.el: (setq org-roam-directory \"/path/of/your/roam/directory\")      To get graphics, download Graphviz (the zip) and extract it where you prefer.    Add this to your config.el: (setq org-roam-graph-executable \"/path/to/dot.exe\")    You might want to add your preferred viewer (or graphs will be open in Firefox by default): (setq org-roam-graph-viewer \"/path/to/image-viewer\")      Run ~/.emacs.d/bin/doom sync    et voilà!.    Here is how taking notes looks in DoomEmacs (from the Org-rom github page).     I still have some pending:    TODO Set Org-roam protocol in Windows   1  C:\\Users\\yourusername is your HOME folder \"~\"     ","description":"","tags":["org","roam","windows","zettelkasten"],"title":"Org-roam \u0026 Windows","uri":"/posts/org_roam_windows/"},{"categories":["emacs"],"content":"  Org-mode is an Emacs mode for note taking, project planing and making TODO lists (because we all need TODO lists to GTD). It can handle more things: Calendar, diary, agenda and export you Org documents to other file extensions. I am not going do talk about all can do with org-mode, you can google yourself for further information. I am going to focus in note taking and export. The org file   It all starts with a file with a .org extension. Create one in Doomemacs with SPC . and name it \"myfile.org\". By default a template should fill the title like: #+TITLE: Myfile   This is part of the heading of the document. Here you can specify some options like the author, email, date or disable the table of contents (toc). #+AUTHOR: Some Author #+EMAIL: Some@email.com #+OPTIONS: toc:nil   After this, the body of the document begins. You start a headline with * and two of them ** indicate a subheadline. You can specify verbatim text between ~|~, code inside =|=, italics surrounded by /|/ and bold text inside *|*. (The | indicates the cursor position, or where you write your text). * Heading 1 ** Heading 1.1 This is ~verbatim~, =code=, /italics/, *bold* and _underlined_ as well.  Lists and TODO's   For simple bullet list you can start it with: - Item one - Item 2   or numbered list 1. First. 2. Second.   The cool thing, is that pressing Alt-RET (alt-enter) will automatically take you to the next line keeping the counting of the items (e.g. If you are in item \"2. Second\" and press Alt-RET the next item will be \"3. |\").  To insert a TODO just type: \"* Buy milk\" and then press SPC m t t to mark it as a TODO. Or press Shift-Right/Left to change the state from \"TODO\" to \"DONE\" * TODO Buy milk. * WAIT Get money to but milk. * DONE Get a Job.  Blocks, comments \u0026 quotes   To start a block just write (ignore the \".\" at the beginning): .#+BEGIN_SRC NameOfTheLanguageCode .#+END_SRC   Quotes and comments are similar #+begin_quote #+end_quote #+BEGIN_COMMENT #+END_COMMENT  Tables, figures \u0026 links   Yes, we can have tables. Use \"|\" and type \"name\", again \"|\", type \"Phone\" and press TAB. You will see how Emacs starts to arrange the table fitting automatically the width according to the content. | Name | Phone | Age | |-------+-------+-----| | Peter | 1234 | 17 | | Anna | 4321 | 25 |   Inserting a figure is simple as typing: [[/path/to/the/image][desciption]]. If you press zi in DoomEmacs it will call the function org-toggle-inline-images and will display the image you set in the document.  The same syntax is used for the links, just type: [[url][desciption]]  In DoomEmacs you can press SPC m l l to insert links and files/images. Final thoughts   The great thing about org-mode is that you can fold/unfold the sections of the document, to navigate quickly trough the notes, and export this plain text document (Yes, if you open the org file in a notepad you will see just plain text, is Emacs that renders the plain text) to a more common document types such as:    Org document –\u003e LaTeX document -\u003e PDF document.    Org document –\u003e ODT document (the free alternative to Microsoft doc files, look at LibreOffice project).    Org document –\u003e Markdown document (another plain text format).    Org document –\u003e html document.    Org document –\u003e Plain text document.    You can export from one to another document with Pandoc, which was meant to convert from Markdown to any type of document. As the Pandoc's page says:   If you need to convert files from one markup format into another, pandoc is your swiss-army knife. Pandoc can convert between the following formats.   And there are several formats. However, for simple day-life PDF, html, ODT and plain text (for emails) the Emacs org-export works fine.  As an example, an org document can look like this   ","description":"","tags":["orgmode","emacs"],"title":"Org-mode","uri":"/posts/org_mode/"},{"categories":["DoomEmacs","windows"],"content":"  Doom-emacs. It's a configuration framework for Emacs. Basically, it overrides the Emacs keybindings with most of vim's.  As I mentioned in the last post. I started using Emacs at work due to org-mode… and work PC's use windows behind a Firewall, so using git, pip, melpa and some more are useless in my work desktop (In the Laptop all of them work if I connect to another network, which was what I did).  As you can imagine, Doom is for a GNU program so Windows support is limited (because, who cares?). The guide is poor, it describes how to install it with scoop/chocolatey (that don't work with a firewall). However, you can use the git-bash to install Doom without scoop/chocolatey. Here is how you do it: What you need   If you have limited permissions in Windows PC (e.g. admin privileges), you might not be able to use Chocolatey/Scoop. However, you can still use git-bash.exe portable version!    Download git.    Download Ripgrep and fd. Make sure you download the windows-gnu version.    Of course, download emacs.    Extract the binaries1 from Ripgrep and fd to their respective folders and place them where you want.    You should have one folder for Ripgrep and another for fd.    Extract emacs and place it where you want. It does not matter where they are, we will add them to the Path later (but keep them safe and where you can remember). Instructions  Edit system environment variables     Go to Control panel -\u003e User Accounts -\u003e Change my environment variables.    New, type HOME and set your C:\\Users\\USERNAME and OK.    Select Path, edit and add your C:\\path\\to\\the\\emacs\\bin folder and OK.    Select Path, edit and add your C:\\path\\to\\the\\ripgrep folder and OK.    Select Path, edit and add your C:\\path\\to\\the\\fd folder and OK.    Click Ok.      We still need to add C:\\Users\\USERNAME\\.emacs.d\\bin; but first download Doom files.   Install Doom     Open git-bash.exe    Type cd ~    Run: git clone https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs ~/.emacs.d    After the download is completed, type cd ~/.emacs.d/bin and run: ./doom install    If everything is fine, Doom is now installed.    Just in case run ./doom sync    Go to Control panel -\u003e User Accounts -\u003e Change my environment variables.    Select Path, edit and add C:\\Users\\USERNAME\\.emacs.d\\bin, click OK -\u003e OK.      Now you can start emacs and will see the Doom dashboard!   All the icons   By default all-the-icons will not be enabled in Windows.    If all-the-icons is not installed. Open emacs and M-x package-install RET all-the-icons RET.    M-x all-the-icons-install-fonts select where to download the fonts and install them (double click -\u003e install).    Restart emacs and there you go.   From one PC to another   If one of your PCs does not have internet connection or is under a firewall, you can:    Copy your ~/.doom.d ~/.emacs.d ripgrep fd emacs folders directly to the other PC (~/.domm.d ~/.emacs.d go in C:\\Users\\USERNAME)    Edit the system environment variables accordingly.    Copy and install the fonts you downloaded with all-the-icons    Open git-bash.exe, cd ~/.emacs.d/bin and run: ./doom sync    et voilà!.   Emacs server   If you use emacs server, Doom will place the server file in C:\\Users\\USERNAME\\.emacs.d\\.local\\cache\\server folder.    Go to Control panel -\u003e User Accounts -\u003e Change my environment variables.    New type EMACS_SERVER_FILE and set the file path C:\\Users\\USERNAME\\.emacs.d\\.local\\cache\\server\\server.    Create a emacsclientw.exe shortcut with emacsclientw.exe -nc in target, run emacs server and emacsclientw will work.      Now, rejoice!    1  with binaries I mean the .exe     ","description":"","tags":["doom","emacs","windows","git"],"title":"Doom, Emacs \u0026 Windows","uri":"/posts/doom_emacs_windows/"},{"categories":null,"content":" First things first   This place is going to be my personal blog. I am going to write about nerd things I don't generally speak with people. Such things include: Emacs, linux, vim, encryption and a e s t h e t i c s.  This blog is hosted in github, written in Emacs with org-mode and posted with Hugo (This is one of the topics I'll be posting later: How to blog with github and Hugo).  Recently, I started using emacs at work due to org-mode. I have used emacs in linux for a few months after loving LaTex previews (I am going to post about this later as well). However, at work I have to use windows under heavily firewalls and that complicate the Emacs installation.  I have always though that Emacs is neat. Just reading the name in a monospaced font makes me think that Emacs is elegant. I love Emacs and I used the vanilla key-bindings when I started using it, but never liked them. When I decided to used Emacs, I remember reading the documentation for minimal use and it went something like:   So you just have to press C-u C-x C-c … wait what??   I was very used to vim key-bindings, so the Emacs learning curve was very long. After some months, I was able to use Emacs comfortably for taking quick notes at work meetings and organizing my pending tasks (Yes, TODO's), but the key-bindings were tedious.  Luckily, there are frameworks that allows you to emulate vim key-bindings in Emacs. Some of these frameworks are: Spacemacs, Centaur Emacs and Doom-emacs. The latest, is the one I use now and installing in windows was and Odyssey but worth it!  The next posts are going to be about:    How to install Doom-emacs in windows    Org-mode \u0026 org-roam    … and we'll see.
