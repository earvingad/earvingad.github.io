      <title>Headscale, how to self-host tailscale</title>

      <description>Previously, we spoke of how easy is to set a mesh network between your devices with tailscale. Usually, that will work for most of the people, but in the view that you are using a third party server that might log your activity you would probably want to avoid that and maybe self host the mesh management (there are huge communities that like to selfhost this kind of services of their homelab).</description>

      <title>DuckDNS, forget your ip</title>

      <description>Duck DNS is a free service which will point a DNS (sub domains of duckdns.org) to an IP of your choice.
In other words, you can create:
yourverycoolandawesomewebsitethatnooneknowsabout.duckdns.org
that will point to the ip of your homelab or VPS.
Why? Well, I already wrote about how to access remotely to your homelab using the Tor network. Also how it can be simplified using Tailscale and to avoid sending data to tailscale servers you could use headscale to selfhost.</description>

      <title>Netdata, real-time server monitoring</title>

      <description>If you have a server, you know it is useful to have information of your server to troubleshoot and detect problems or bad configurations, usage of the CPU, ram, network and health of the HDD.
There are plenty of options: monit, monitorix, munin, Netdata and Grafana (coupled with one data collector like: collectd, influxdb, Graphite or Prometheus)
Despite Grafana is one of the most popular choices, I decided to use Netdata, since it is pre-configured out of the box and it does both collect data and create graphs displayed through a http server.</description>

      <title>Tailscale, making WireGuard simpler for home networks</title>

      <description>Recently I wrote about how to use the Tor network as a free VPN and how to make as secure as possible in the Tor a hidden friend to SSH your home network entry. However, I recommended to use WireGuard to connect securely and fast to your home network if you could set port forwarding on your router and leave Tor as a last option, since it is slow and its main goal is to serve as a circumvent censorship tool rather than a VPN.</description>

      <description>You might had heard of the Dark web or the Deep web, well the first one is just a small part of the latter. The Dark web is populated with darknets which is an overlay network within the Internet that can only be accessed with specific software, configurations, or authorization.
These darknets can be small peer-to-peer networks or large as the I2P Anonymous Network, Freenet and the most popular Tor Project.</description>

      <description>The OpenWrt Project is a Linux operating system targeting embedded devices. Instead of trying to create a single, static firmware, OpenWrt provides a fully writable filesystem with package management. This frees you from the application selection and configuration provided by the vendor and allows you to customize the device through the use of packages to suit any application(…)
Yeeeah baby! good soup!
Have you ever hated your wireless router so much that you wanted to smash it to the wall because it is just a piece of useless shit?</description>
