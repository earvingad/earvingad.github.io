      <description>I wanted to write a post about Orgzly for a few days, but I have been very busy these days. As I told in previous posts, I started using orgmode at work, but not for my everyday personal tasks… and suddenly I came across with Orgzly.
Orgzly is an outliner for notes and to-do lists for Android devices! It basically allows you to write notes as in org-mode in Emacs, but in your phone —because you wont be carrying your laptop all day.</description>

      <description>Org-roam Org-roam is a note-taking tool for Emacs using Org-mode. It is a replica of RoamResearch: &amp;#34;A note-taking tool for networked thought&amp;#34;. Both are based in the Zettelkasten method, which is described as:
Using a Zettelkasten is about optimizing a workflow of learning and producing knowledge.
The method was developed by Niklas Luhmann and the literal translation is:
Zettelkasten = Box of notes.
In simple words: Org-roam allows you to make connections between your notes, in order to make a more efficient creative/learning process.</description>
