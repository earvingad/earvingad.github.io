&lt;em&gt;As a Coffee lover…&lt;/em&gt; of course this post had to start that way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I have a dumb coffee machine for my morning coffee on my way to work. It is just an on-off coffee machine, the brewing cycle last around 10 min and then it just keeps warm the jar. Wouldn&amp;#39;t it be a good idea to make it smart so the coffee will be ready when I wake up?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I bought a sonoff mini r2 with the intention to automate my bedroom light. It requires a neutral wire to work, so it was quite difficult to use in my room due to light is connected in a two way switch and it does not have neutral wire. Eventually, I sorted it out by pulling a neutral from a plug close to one of the switches. However, in the process I screwed it up…&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you started to install smart devices, you realized that you need apps to manage the devices. The more popular are Tuya, Smart life and eWeLink. However, they come with a drawback: They rely on the third party cloud, if you loss internet connection you won&amp;#39;t be able to control the devices. In order to solve that you can re-flash the devices with another software. In other words, override the software of the device which will allow you to control the device locally. I&amp;#39;ll discuss some I&amp;#39;ve used just for put them in your radar.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
