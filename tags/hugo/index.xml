      <description>It&amp;#39;s been three years since I started this blog using Hugo and GitHub pages, but I never enabled comments since this blog makes use of static pages, some users commented my posts using github issues and I thought it was a good idea. There were many workarounds to enable comments in github pages, but I wasn&amp;#39;t convinced. Luckily, yesterday I found out about utterances.
A lightweight comments widget built on GitHub issues.</description>

      <title>Blog with Hugo (and GitHub Pages)</title>

      <description>Hugo is one of the most popular open-source static site generators. With its amazing speed and flexibility, Hugo makes building websites fun again.
That&amp;#39;s in the Hugo website and I guess it&amp;#39;s true, since I find it very easy to use to publish this dumb blog when I have the time to.
Now, Hugo will generate the static site in your PC but how can you make it accessible from the Internet?</description>

      <description>First things first This place is going to be my personal blog. I am going to write about nerd things I don&amp;#39;t generally speak with people. Such things include: Emacs, linux, vim, encryption and a e s t h e t i c s.
This blog is hosted in github, written in Emacs with org-mode and posted with Hugo (This is one of the topics I&amp;#39;ll be posting later: How to blog with github and Hugo).</description>
