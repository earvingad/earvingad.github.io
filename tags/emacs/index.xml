      <description>Hugo is one of the most popular open-source static site generators. With its amazing speed and flexibility, Hugo makes building websites fun again.
That&amp;#39;s in the Hugo website and I guess it&amp;#39;s true, since I find it very easy to use to publish this dumb blog when I have the time to.</description>

      <description>Org-mode is an Emacs mode for note taking, project planing and making TODO lists (because we all need TODO lists to GTD). It can handle more things: Calendar, diary, agenda and export you Org documents to other file extensions. I am not going do talk about all can do with org-mode, you can google yourself for further information.</description>

      <description>Doom-emacs. It&amp;#39;s a configuration framework for Emacs. Basically, it overrides the Emacs keybindings with most of vim&amp;#39;s.
As I mentioned in the last post. I started using Emacs at work due to org-modeâ€¦ and work PC&amp;#39;s use windows behind a Firewall, so using git, pip, melpa and some more are useless in my work desktop (In the Laptop all of them work if I connect to another network, which was what I did).</description>
