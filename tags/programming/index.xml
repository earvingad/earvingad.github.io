      <description>I remember once hearing &amp;#34;No matter what you do for living, learn a programming language it will ease your life.&amp;#34;
Although, using Linux takes you to a long trip of practicing scripting with bash, I was never really into programming (still not, eventhough I would have liked at some point).
From my school years, I think the first programming language I was in touch with was C++ in highschool.</description>
